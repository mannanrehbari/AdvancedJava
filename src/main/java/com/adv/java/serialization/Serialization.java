    Serializable Field Objects
    During serialization in Java, associated field objects must be serializable.

    Writing Serialized Objects to a File
    In Java, a serialized object may be written to a file and read using FileOutputStream and FileInputStream.

    writeObject() and readObject()
    In Java, implementing the writeObject() and readObject() will define a customized way of serializing and deserializing an object.

    Serialization
    Serialization is the process of converting an objectâ€™s state into a stream of bytes.

    serialVersionUID
    In Java, a class implementing Serializable needs a serialVersionUID to confirm class compatibility during deserialization.

    Serializable Class
    A class (or any of its parent classes) must implement the Serialiazable interface (or any of its children interfaces) in order to be serializable.

    Deserialization
    Deserialization is the process of converting a stream of bytes, created after serialization, back into an object.

    Benefits of Serialization
    Serialization is beneficial when an object needs to be stored or sent over a network.

    Static and Transient Fields
    In Java, any field not marked as static or transient is serializable.
